# Curso-em-video-python-world1
This a repository about the exercises I did in the free course "Curso em VÃ­deo - Python Mundo 01". This course is a Python course by professor Gustavo Guanabara and is available on Youtube and his own website "https://www.cursoemvideo.com". Ps: I finished this course in November 16, 2022 and I create the repository in January 27, 2023 because I new on the Github and programming. That course I did without knowledge about Logic of Programmation or the basics, that was a mistake who I did, I tried to read the official document and recoding a lot of times to run it. So, I finished the course and in November 19, 2022 I started the course about Logic of Programmation. Soon I will complete this course and post the exercises finished. Goodbye and take care - NLeopy
